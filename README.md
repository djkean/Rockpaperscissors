## [Check it out here!](https://djkean.github.io/Rockpaperscissors/)

 A classic game that served as a great and fun introduction to coding - my first project. 
 Play against the computer and enjoy some ~~awful~~ very high quality pictures I created for this project!

This project is currently considered "completed"

This was part of my learning experience with [Get Coding](https://www.get-coding.ca).
